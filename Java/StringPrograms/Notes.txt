String is a final predefined class.
String objects are used to store sequence of characters.

Since String is a final class We will not be able to extend any class to this String class.

String literals create objects in SCP(String Constant Pool). It provides memory management.

When We store data in String object, each character is given an index starting from 0 to length-1.
String is a class so it has many methods in it. Most commonly used methods are:-

1) length(): This method will give you the total number of characters in the String.
2) charAt(index): This method will get the character present in the given index.
3) toUpperCase(): This method returns a new String object in which all letters are in capital.
4) toLowerCase(): This method returns a new String object in which all letters are in small.
5) contains(word): This method returns true if it finds the given word in a String otherwise it returns false.
6) replace(oldChar, newChar): This method returns a new String in which all the old character is replaced
								by new character.
7) replace(oldString,newString): This method returns a new String in which all the old String is replaced
								by new String.
8) replaceFirst(oldString,newString): This method returns a new String where only the first occurrence of the
								word old String is replaced by new String.
9) indexOf(char): This method returns the index of the first occurrence of the given character.
10)lastIndexOf(char): This method returns the index of the last occurrence of the given character.
11)indexOf(String): This method returns the index of the first occurrence of the given String.
12)indexOf(char, startIndex): This method returns the index of the first occurrence of the given character
							starting the search from given startIndex.
13)indexOf(String, startIndex): This method returns the index of the first occurrence of the given String
							starting the search from given startIndex.
14)substring(index): This method returns a new String in which there are all characters of the original
							String starting from the given index.
15)substring(startIndex, offsetIndex): This method returns a new String in which there are all characters
							from the original String from the given startIndex upto offsetIndex-1.
							We will not see the character present in offsetIndex.
16)startsWith():
17)endsWith():
18)equals():
19)equalsIgnoreCase():
20)compareTo():
21)compareToIgnoreCase():
22)concat(): It will create a new object will all the new characters attached to original value.
