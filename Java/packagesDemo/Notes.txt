Packages are used to group similar classes, interfaces and enums together.

Uses of packages: -
1) Naming convenience: We can make classes with the same name in different packages. Hence We are able to use the
same name again and again.
2) Protection: Packages provide protection to the classes and interfaces because the access specifiers work on
the basis of packages.
Example: - default methods or variables will not be visible from any class present outside the package.
3) Code Reusability: If We want to use the code of a class from some other package, We have the option of
importing that class in our program.

Sub-packages: These are packages made inside another package.
