Difference between Abstract class and Interface
1) abstract classes can have both abstract and concrete methods, meaning abstract class gives partial abstraction.
	Interfaces have by default all abstract methods, hence it gives 100% or full abstraction.
	
2) Abstract class can have constructors.
	Interfaces cannot have constructors.
	
3) Abstract class is extended by another class using 'extends' keyword.
	Interfaces are implemented by another class by 'implements' keyword.
	
4) A class can extend only one abstract class.
	A class can implement many interfaces.
	
5) Abstract class can have variables of any type.
	Interface have all variables by default public, static and final. 

6) Abstract class does not support multiple inheritance.
   Interface support multiple inheritance using implement keyword.
   
Note:- 
Interface and abstract class reference can be made for upcasting.
