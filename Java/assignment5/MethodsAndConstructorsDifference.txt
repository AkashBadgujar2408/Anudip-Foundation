3) Write the difference between method and constructor
Ans:
	Methods:
	- Methods are the set of statements that are used to perform a particular task.
	- Methods can be called multiple times from an object.
	- Methods have return type (void,String,int etc)
	- Compiler cannot add methods by itself. The user has to define the methods.
	- When multiple methods with the same name but different signature (type, order or number of parameters)
	is made it is called "Method Overloading".
	
	Constructors:
	- Constructors are the specialized methods that have the same name as that of the class which does not have
	any return type.
	- Constructors would be called and executed at the time of object creation.
	- Constructors are called only once per an object.
	- Constructors do not have any return type.
	- The major use of constructor is to initialize the instance variables at the time of object creation.
	- By default a constructor is added by the compiler if not defined by user.
	- When multiple constructors with the same name but different signature (type, order or number of parameters)
	is made it is called "Constructor Overloading".
